<p> I'm a local pickleball player who offers discounted pickleball paddles, balls, bags, covers, etc up to 60-80% off. I also offer coaching at the most value in Utah. </p>

<p>I'm a low 5.0 pickleball player who offers lessons in Weber, Davis, Box Elder, Cache, SLC, and Utah counties for 25$ for an hour and a half lesson for as many people as you'd like to bring. Comparatively most pickleball lessons are taught by better 5.0 players who teach for 35+$ per person for an hour.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure the importance of coaching my coach when I first met him asked me if I wanted to get better and I said yes. He then told me in 20 seconds what to work on and within a week I was twice as good at pickleball and my current best shot is thanks to him. I thought to myself if he made my game twice as good in 20 seconds what could he do with an hour. Coaching is invaluable and is totally worth it if you are playing a lot of pickleball. </p>
